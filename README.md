## System Structure

The system was represented using a C4 diagram, in order to effectively represent the system arhitecture and functionality.
The diagram has the following levels:
1. Context Diagram - represents the main purpose of the system

2. Container Diagram - represents the system containers at a high level

3. Component Diagram - shows a more detailed decomposition of the components
